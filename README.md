# asterisk-raspberrypi
Project implementation of an Asterisk Raspberry Pi and Asterisk Server
Everything that has occurred to me I have done, or almost everything, on a Raspberry pi, sometimes a friend makes jokes by mentioning the things I do in it, and that is why he says that it is a raspberrybomb, of so many things I do in her.

This time the following scenario occurs to me:
use the minutes of my home phone plan, not even my phone, rather my mother's, yes, like that !!. This applies to the office, so you would have your conventional phone in your pockets.
